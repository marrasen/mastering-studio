// Package plug is a plugin format for audio effects written in Go: a
// plugin is a Go package, compiled into the app that uses it, which
// registers itself as it starts.
//
// It follows VST3 where VST3 works well, so an adapter can run a VST3
// plugin through the same interfaces: parameters declared up front,
// sound processed in blocks with parameter changes at frames within
// them, and a latency and a tail. It parts from VST3 in three places.
// The host owns the parameters and the state, so it keeps one undo
// history and one preset browser for every plugin. A plugin's views are
// gunim nodes the host places where it likes, in three sizes. And a
// plugin may read whole tracks, as ARA 2 lets one, through
// [TrackPlugin].
//
// The package is young, and grows in the Mastering Studio until its
// shape settles.
